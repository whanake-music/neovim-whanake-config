# Whanake's Neovim Configuration
These are the configuration files I use for my Neovim installation.

The purpose of this repository is to allow me to use these files anytime I install Neovim on a different system, and keep track of any changes I make in the future.

Feel free to use this configuration for your own Neovim install, but please note that I don't plan on maintaining this for a wide range of users, this repository is meant for my personal use.

That being said, if anyone would like to make suggestions as to how I can improve this configuration, feel free to do so by submitting an issue or pull request. I don't plan on merging every change I see, but I'd be happy to see your suggestions and learn from my potential mistakes!

## Installation
Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration folder (for me, that's `~/.config/nvim/`). Then, open the `init.lua` file and type `:source`. Everything should sort itself out automatically.
